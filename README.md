# LearnPython
### by Blagovest.Manolov
A project made for educational purposes. I am a student and decided to make an application through which we can learn Python.

### For this purpose I have used the following libraries:
- :rocket: Tkinter
- :rocket: Random
### The fonts used are taken from Google Fonts, or as follows:
- [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?query=Cinzel)
- [Lakki Reddy](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lakki+Reddy?query=Lakki)
- [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?query=Source+Code+Pro)
